# Pondering Paths
This module will teach you the basics of Linux file paths!
A path from the root of the filesystem starts with / (that is, the root of the filesystem), and describes the set of directories that must be descended into to find the file. 

## 2.1 The Root

Launch a terminal, invoke the pwn program using its absolute path, you'll be giving the exact path, starting from /, so the path would be /pwn.
 
### Flag 
```
 pwn.college{ocIlkw80hFAtE9SwpLGuEjONk0M.dhzN5QDL3IDO0czW}
```

## 2.2 Program and absolute paths

The path to the challenge the directory is, thus, /challenge. The name of the challenge program in this level is run, and it lives in the /challenge directory. Thus, the path to the run challenge program is /challenge/run.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{0slmfrgaVEBjQqHtBzp7ppyNQ0f.dVDN1QDL3IDO0czW}
```

## 2.3 Position thy self

This challenge will require you to execute the /challenge/run program from a specific path (which it will tell you). You'll need to cd to that directory before rerunning the challenge program

 hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/$ /run
bash: /run: Is a directory
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/include/gnu directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/$ cd /usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/include/gnu
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/include/gnu$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!

### Flag
```
