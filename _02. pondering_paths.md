# Pondering Paths
This module will teach you the basics of Linux file paths!
 A path from the root of the filesystem starts with / (that is, the root of the filesystem), and describes the set of directories that must be descended into to find the file. 

## 2.1 The Root

Launch a terminal, invoke the pwn program using its absolute path, you'll be giving the exact path, starting from /, so the path would be /pwn.
 
### Flag 
```
